README for Thread::Exit

This module add two features to threads that are sorely missed by some: a
thread local exit() (that only exits the thread and not the whole program)
and the equivalent of an END subroutine (which is executed when the thread
is done, but before the thread returns).

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.
