=head1 DESCRIPTION

                  *** A note of CAUTION ***

 This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.
 And then only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It
 is of no use with any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without
 threads enabled.

                  *************************

This module adds three features to threads that are sorely missed by some.

The first feature is that you can use exit() within a thread to return() from
that thread only.  Without this module, exit() stops B<all> threads and exits
to the calling process (which usually is the operating system).  With this
module, exit() functions just as return() (including passing back values to
the parent thread).

The second feature is that you can specify a subroutine that will be executed
B<after> the thread is started, but B<before> the subroutine of which the
thread consists, is started.  This is an alternate implementation of the
CLONE subroutine, which differs by being B<really> executed inside the context
of the new thread (as shown by the value of C<threads->tid>). Multiple "begin"
subroutines can be chained together if necessary.

The third feature is that you can specify a subroutine that will be executed
B<after> the thread is done, but B<before> the thread returns to the parent
thread.  This is similar to the END subroutine, but on a thread basis.
Multiple "end" subroutines can be chained together if necessary.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

These are the class methods.

=head2 begin

 Thread::Exit->begin( 'begin' );             # execute "begin"

 Thread::Exit->begin( undef );               # don't execute anything

 Thread::Exit->begin( 'module::before',-1 ); # execute "module::before" first

 Thread::Exit->begin( \&after,1 );           # execute "after" last

 $begin = Thread::Exit->begin;               # return current code reference

The "begin" class method sets and returns the subroutine that will be executed
B<after> the current thread is started but B<before> it starts the actual
subroutine of which the thread consists.  It is similar to the CLONE
subroutine, but is really executed in the context of the thread (whereas
CLONE currently fakes this for performance reasons, causing XS routines and
threads->tid to be executed in the wrong context).

The first input parameter is the name or a reference to the subroutine that
should be executed before this thread really starts.  It can be specified as a
name or as a code reference.  No changes will be made if no parameters are
specified.  If the first parameter is undef()ined or empty, then no subroutine
will be executed when this thread has started.

The second input parameter only has meaning if there has been a "begin"
subroutine specified before.  The following values are recognized:

=over 2

=item replace (0)

If the value B<0> is specified, then the new subroutine specification will
B<replace> any current "begin" subroutine specification done earlier.  This is
the default.

=item after (1)

If the value B<1> is specified, then the subroutine specificed will be
executed B<after> any other "begin" subroutine that was specified earlier.

=item before (-1)

If the value B<-1> is specified, then the subroutine specificed will be
executed B<before> any other "begin" subroutine that was specified earlier.

=back

By default, new threads inherit the settings of the "begin" subroutine.
Check the L<inherit> method to change this.

=head2 end

 Thread::Exit->end( 'end' );               # execute "end"

 Thread::Exit->end( undef );               # don't execute anything

 Thread::Exit->end( 'module::before',-1 ); # execute "module::before" first

 Thread::Exit->end( \&after,1 );           # execute "after" last

 $end = Thread::Exit->end;                 # return current code reference

The "end" class method sets and returns the subroutine that will be executed
B<after> the current thread is finished but B<before> it will return via a
join().

The first input parameter is the name or a reference to the subroutine that
should be executed after this thread is finished.  It can be specified as a
name or as a code reference.  No changes will be made if no parameters are
specified.  If the first parameter is undef()ined or empty, then no subroutine
will be executed when this thread ends.

The second input parameter only has meaning if there has been an "end"
subroutine specified before.  The following values are recognized:

=over 2

=item replace (0)

If the value B<0> is specified, then the new subroutine specification will
B<replace> any current "end" subroutine specification done earlier.  This is
the default.

=item after (1)

If the value B<1> is specified, then the subroutine specificed will be
executed B<after> any other "end" subroutine that was specified earlier.

=item before (-1)

If the value B<-1> is specified, then the subroutine specificed will be
executed B<before> any other "end" subroutine that was specified earlier.

=back

By default, new threads inherit the settings of the "end" subroutine.
Check the L<inherit> method to change this.

=head2 inherit

 Thread::Exit->inherit( 1 );         # default, new threads inherit

 Thread::Exit->inherit( 0 );         # new threads don't inherit

 $inherit = Thread::Exit->inherit;   # return current setting

The "inherit" class method sets and returns whether newly created threads
will inherit the "begin" and "end" subroutine settings (as previously
indicated with a call to the L<begin> or L<end> class methods).

If an input parameter is specified, it indicates the new setting of this flag.
A true value indicates that new threads should inherit the "begin" and "end"
subroutine settings.  A false value indicates that new threads should B<not>
have any "begin" or "end" subroutine (unless of course specified otherwise
inside the thread after the thread has started).

The default settings is B<1>, causing L<begin> and L<end> settings to be
inherited by newly created threads.

=head2 ismain

 Thread::Exit->ismain;

The "ismain" class method is only needed in very special situation.  It marks
the current thread as the "main" thread from which a "real" exit() should
occur.

By default, only the thread in which the C<use Thread::Exit> occurred, will
perform a "real" exit (either to CORE::exit() or to Apache::exit() when in a
mod_perl environment).  This may however, not always be right.  In those cases
you can use this class method.

=head1 MOD_PERL

To allow this module to function under Apache with mod_perl, a special check
is included for the existence of the Apache::exit() subroutine.  If the
Apache::exit() subroutine exists, then that exit routine will be preferred
over the CORE::exit() routine when exiting from the thread in which the
first C<use Thread::Exit> occurred.

=head1 CAVEATS

Because transport of data structures between threads is severely limited in
the current threads implementation (perl 5.8.0), data structures need to be
serialized.  This is achieved by using the L<Thread::Serialize> library.
Please check that module for information about the limitations (of any) of
data structure transport between threads.

=head1 TODO

Examples should be added.
