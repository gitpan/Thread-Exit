	Missed the fact that threads->create is a synonym for threads->new.
	Before, threads->create still referred to the original threads->new
	rather than the one we put in its place.  Now fixed thanks to spot
	by Tom Brettin.  Adapted test-suite as well.

	Changed "$new" package lexical into a closure.

0.05	13 August 2003
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Increased
	dependency on Thread::Serialize to 0.06.

	Fixed some warnings that could be fixed.  Added message for those
	warnings that can not be fixed (for now).

0.04	30 September 2002
        Use "load.pm" instead of AutoLoader.  Increased dependency on
        Thread::Serialize to 0.05, which also uses "load.pm".

        Removed "our" from $VERSION, should shave off some bytes in
        memory usage, as found from testing with Benchmark::Thread::Size.

0.03	6 September 2002
	Fixed some problems with real exit() in main thread + regression
	test added.  Suggested by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.

	Test for "ismain" added.

0.02	5 September 2002
	Added "begin" subroutine support + documentation + test-suite.
	Nick Ing-Simmons suggested this on p5p.  It seemed like an easy
	thing to add.  And it was.

	Since "begin" would make an automatic = 1 as the default much more
	sensible, I've changed the default behaviour to have threads
	automatically inherit any "begin" and "end" subroutine specifications.
	And to make the naming of the subroutines more consistent, "automatic"
	was renamed to "inherit".  All of this makes it incompatible with
	0.01, so it was released as soon as possible on the same day as 0.01.

	Added class method documentation.

	Added support for "ismain" class method, to mark the current thread
	as the "main" thread from which a "real" exit() should occur.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

	Oops, VERSION file was wrong.  It now correctly shows 0.02.

0.01	5 September 2002
	First version of Thread::Exit.
